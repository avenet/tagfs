# TagFS

TagFS is a tag-based distributed filesystem. The project was created by [Abel Puentes Luberta][abelpuentes], [Andy Venet Pompa][andy.venet], [Ariel Hernández Amador][gnuaha7], and [Yasser González Fernández][ygonzalezfernandez] in fulfillment of the final assignment of an undergraduate course on distributed systems for Computer Science students taught at the University of Havana, Cuba. Therefore, the documentation of the project and the git comments were written in Spanish. Everything in the Python code but the docstrings is in English, though.
